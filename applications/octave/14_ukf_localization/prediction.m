#this function implements the kalman prediction step of our UKF localization system
# inputs: 
#   transition: is a data structure containing several things,
#               coming from the simulator
#               of these we are interested only in the offset
#               accessible through the "v" field of the structure
#               
#               transition.v(1)=offset x
#               transition.v(2)=offset y (ignore for a diff drive robot)
#               transition.v(3)=offset theta 
#
#  mu: is the mean of the robot pose
#  sigma: is the mean of the previously estimated robot pose (3x3 matrix)
#
# outputs 
# [sigmaP, weightsM, weightsC]: sigma points and weights
