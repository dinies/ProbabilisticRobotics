# Total Least Squares

A cool example of a least squares system for `pose-landmark`, `pose-landmark-projection` and `pose-pose constraints`.

Run octave GUI (in order to manipulate the generated windows easily)

    octave

**From the octave GUI command line** run:

    TotalLeastSquares

- To inspect the convergence of the LS system enter **in the octave GUI command line**:

        chi_stats_l

- for the landmarks

        chi_stats_r

- for the robot poses

        chi_stats_p

- for the projections
