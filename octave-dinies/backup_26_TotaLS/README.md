# Total Least Squares

Cool example of a least squares system for `pose-landmark`, `pose-landmark-projection` and `pose-pose constraints`.

To test it:

- run octave

        TotalLeastSquares
        chi_stats_{l,r,p} 

This shows the `chi_stats` of 

- `l` Landmarks
- `p` Projections
- `r` Robot poses
