#  landmarks: a structure of landmarks, we can fetch the
#            position of a landmark given its index
#            by using the tools in the library
#  observations:
#            a structure containing n observations of landmarks
#            for each observation we have
#            - the index of the landmark seen
#            - the location where we have seen the landmark (x,y) w.r.t the robot
#outputs:
#  [mu, sigma]: the updated mean and covariance
